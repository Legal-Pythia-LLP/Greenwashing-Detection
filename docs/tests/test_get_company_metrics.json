We use the Dashboard to compare aggregated and anonymised data from industry peers and, where available, against living wage estimates of the Global Living Wage Coalition (GLWC), developed by the Anker Research Institute**. Where GLWC estimates are not available, namely in Indonesia, we used 2022 Fair Wage Network benchmarks***.Graph G.10 shows the results of our benchmarking for 60 core Tier 1 factories in local currency, covering wages in 2022. This data covers approximately 75% of PUMA’s global production volume for 145,834 workers employed under those suppliers. 32 factories paid a living wage to 83,089 workers in Cambodia, China, Pakistan and Vietnam, covering 45% of PUMA’s global production volume.
